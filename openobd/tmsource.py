"""
tmsource — feed the Dashboard's gauge cluster from truck-mcp drive-log sessions.

This is the adapter that lets a *.tmsession.db drive the same DataSource seam
the GT link and CSV replay use, so the gauges never learn a second data path.
Two shapes, chosen by whether the drive is still being written:

  * An ARCHIVED session becomes a synthesized `logbin.Log` (mapped channels on a
    unified forward-filled timeline) played through the existing LogReplaySource
    — the Dashboard's transport bar (seek/pause/speed) works unchanged.

  * A LIVE session becomes a TmLiveSource: `latest()` follows channel_latest at
    the store's own cadence (reads are throttled to ~1 Hz internally; the
    Dashboard may call at 10 Hz). It also exposes `channel_states()` so the
    cluster can render tmstore's freshness vocabulary — a carried, stale or
    archived value that renders like a live measurement is the tool lying about
    the truck, exactly the contract tmstore.display_state exists to keep.

Mapping is explicit and unit-checked: a store channel reaches a gauge ONLY if
its name is in TM_CHANNEL_MAP *and* its declared unit has a registered
conversion to the gauge's display unit. A channel with an empty or unknown unit
is EXCLUDED (reported, not guessed) — e.g. trans_fluid_temp, whose E38 DID is
still unverified and carries no unit in the store, must not move the °F Trans
bar. Values are converted (°C→°F, km/h→mph) at the seam; the gauges keep their
US display units.

Read-only by construction: everything goes through tmstore.TmSessionReader
(query_only + authorizer). Nothing here can touch the serial port.
