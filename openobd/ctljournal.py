"""
ctljournal — read truck-mcp's control journal, so OpenOBD can DISPLAY vehicle
control state without ever commanding the vehicle.

truck-mcp's actuation gate writes an append-only JSONL journal: every arm, fire,
activation and release, each activation carrying its exact release bytes. That
file is the crash-recovery plan — after a killed control session, an activation
with no matching release means the truck may still be holding an actuator. It is
also the ONLY honest source of "what, if anything, is currently commanded on
this truck", because control state is a function of what the module actually
acknowledged, not of what any UI believes.

OpenOBD reads this file and nothing else on the control path. It holds no lease,
owns no console, sends no frame, and imports no truck-mcp code.

Two safety rules govern the read, learned from the adversarial review:
  * NEVER report "clean" from an absence of evidence. A journal that cannot be
    located, cannot be read, or contains a damaged record yields verdict
    ``unknown`` — rendered as a warning, never as the green all-clear. Unexamined
    is not clean.
  * NEVER miss the field kit. truck-mcp's frozen build (the one that actuates)
    writes its journal beside its own executable, a different tree from a dev
    checkout. outstanding() aggregates EVERY journal found across all candidate
    roots, so a crash in the field kit is not invisible to a reader run from the
    repo.

Pure stdlib, no Qt, unit-testable against fixture JSONL files.
